# Overview

This uses google's tesseract to analyze a Pixel 7a screenshot to find the add
to playlist button and automatically clicks it.

I did this because the add to playlist button could appear in two different
locations which is a huge pain to deal with. Text recognition is the solution.

Other than that this automatically adds songs to a playlist automatically
by clicking specific pixels on a phone screen.
